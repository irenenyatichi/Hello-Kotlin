// The most common way to create a range in Kotlin is to use the .. operator. For example, 1..4 is equivalent to 1, 2, 3, 4.
// To declare a range that doesn't include the end value, use the ..< operator. For example, 1..<4 is equivalent to 1, 2, 3.
// To declare a range in reverse order, use downTo. For example, 4 downTo 1 is equivalent to 4, 3, 2, 1.
// To declare a range that increments in a step that isn't 1, use step and your desired increment value. For example, 1..5 step 2 is equivalent to 1, 3, 5.
// You can also do the same with Char ranges:
// 'a'..'d' is equivalent to 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'
// 'z' downTo 's' step 2 is equivalent to 'z', 'x', 'v', 't'
